								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I am an assistant professor in the College of Education at Kansas State University. 
								My PhD is in Leadership and Policy Studies from the Department of Leadership, 
								Policy, and Organizations at Vanderbilt University. My research interests include teacher leadership
								and school improvement, teacher policy and teacher labor market, and financial aid and postsecondary success. 
								I taught middle and high school math for 
								seven years in St. Louis, Missouri. I hold a 
								dual-degree in Math and Physics from the University of Oklahoma and a Master of Arts in 
								Teaching from Washington University in St. Louis. 
								</p>
								<p>As an instructor I am attentive to the ways in which studentsâ€™ current knowledge can be built upon to help master the course 
								content. By adopting a variety of instructional techniques and student supports, I strive to impart my love of learning 
								to students and to leave students with a strong knowledge base that they can apply to real world problems. My previous 
								experiences, including seven years of experience teaching mathematics at the secondary level, have prepared me to teach and work with students from diverse backgrounds and in a variety of settings.
								</p>
								<p>For more than the decade that I have been involved in education as a secondary teacher and as a graduate student in education 
								policy and leadership, I have had had strong interests in issues of diversity and equity. From my experience as a teacher, and 
								graduate training and research, I have learned that diversity and equity issues are not secondary but rather, they require 
								 constant commitment and examination. I aim to conduct research that is committed to studying issues 
								of social equity, to promote student learning grounded in diverse backgrounds, and to provide mentoring and guidance 
								for graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
