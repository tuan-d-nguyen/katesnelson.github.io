								<h2><a href="research.html">Research</a></h2>
								<p>His K-12 research has two separate strands: a) teacher leadership and school improvement in a research-practice 
								partnership, and b) teacher policies and teacher labor markets. In the first strand of his research, he has been 
								involved in teacher leadership and school improvement work with the IES-funded National Center on Scaling Up Effective 
								Schools (NCSU), a research-practice partnership aimed at linking researchers with practitioners to improve educational 
								outcomes of traditionally underserved high school students in Florida and Texas. The second strand of his K-12 research 
								focuses on teacher policies and the teacher labor markets, particularly looking at the factors that drive teacher attrition 
								and retention, and the reforms and policies intended to address these issues for social equity and school improvement. His work 
								on teacher merit pay has been covered by local and national press, including write-ups in Education Week, The Atlanta Journal 
								Constitution, The Chalkbeat, and Wisconsin Public Radio. Due to his research assistantship with Brent Evans, he also has research 
								interests and experience in higher education. In this area, his research focuses on the distribution of financial aid and its 
								effects on postsecondary persistence and degree attainment, particularly for underserved and disadvantaged students.

								<p>He is attentive to the ways in which studentsâ€™ current knowledge can be built upon to help master the course content. 
								He has consistently received excellent evaluations as a secondary teacher and as a TA in graduate and doctoral classes.  
								By adopting a variety of instructional techniques and student supports, he strives to impart my love of learning to students 
								and to leave students with a strong knowledge base that they can apply to real world problems. These previous experiences have 
								prepared him to teach and work with students from diverse backgrounds and in a variety of settings.

								<h2><a href="diversity.html">Diversity</a></h2>
								<p>For more than a decade where he has been involved in education as a secondary teacher and as a graduate student in education 
								policy and leadership, he has had strong interests in issues of diversity and equity. From his experience as a teacher, and graduate 
								training and research, he has learned that diversity and equity issues are not secondary but rather, they require a constant commitment and 
								examination. His goals would be to conduct research that is committed to studying issues of social equity, to promote student learning grounded 
								in diverse backgrounds, and to provide mentoring and guidance for graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
