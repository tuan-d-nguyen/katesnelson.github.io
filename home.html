								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Management & Policy in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University.  
								I conduct inter and trans-disciplinary research that focuses on analysis of social structures that interact with the built and natural environment 
								to promote or harm social equity, ecological and human health, and long-term viability of social-environmental systems with a methodological emphasis on consideration 
								of spatial and temporal dependencies. I have MS and BS degrees in Environmental Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and 
								the University of Oklahoma, respectively. Prior to my doctoral studies at Vanderbilt University I served as the Lab Manager and Senior Scientist of
								the National Science Foundation funded Nano Research Facility at Washington University in St. Louis.
