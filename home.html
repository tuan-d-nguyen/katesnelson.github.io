								I conduct research on teacher labor market etc....that focuses on analysis of social structures that interact with the built and natural environment 
								to promote or harm social equity, ecological and human health, and long-term viability of social-environmental systems with a methodological emphasis on consideration 
								of spatial and temporal dependencies. I have MS and BS degrees in Environmental Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and
