title: Diversity
---
	<p>For more than the decade that I have been involved in education as a secondary teacher and as a graduate student in education 
	policy and leadership, I have had had strong interests in issues of diversity and equity. From my experience as a teacher, and 
		graduate training and research, I have learned that diversity and equity issues are not secondary but rather, they require 
		 constant commitment and examination. I aim to conduct research that is committed to studying issues 
		of social equity, to promote student learning grounded in diverse backgrounds, and to provide mentoring and guidance 
		for graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
