	<h3>Diversity</h3>
	
								<p>For more than a decade where he has been involved in education as a secondary teacher and as a graduate student in education 
								policy and leadership, he has had strong interests in issues of diversity and equity. From his experience as a teacher, and graduate 
								training and research, he has learned that diversity and equity issues are not secondary but rather, they require a constant commitment and 
								examination. His goals would be to conduct research that is committed to studying issues of social equity, to promote student learning grounded 
								in diverse backgrounds, and to provide mentoring and guidance for graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
