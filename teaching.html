	<p>As an instructor I am attentive to the ways in which studentsâ€™ current knowledge can be built upon to help master the course 
		content. I have consistently received excellent evaluations as a secondary teacher and as a TA in graduate and doctoral 
		classes.  By adopting a variety of instructional techniques and student supports, I strive to impart my love of learning 
		to students and to leave students with a strong knowledge base that they can apply to real world problems. My previous 
		experiences, including seven years of experience teaching mathematics at the secondary level at < a href =" http://jburroughs.org/">
		John Burroughs School</a>, have prepared me to teach and work with students from diverse backgrounds and in a variety of settings.
