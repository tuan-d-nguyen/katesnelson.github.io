	<p>As an instructor I am attentive to the ways in which studentsâ€™ current knowledge can be built upon to help master the course 
		content. I have consistently received excellent evaluations as a secondary teacher and as a TA in graduate and doctoral 
		classes.  By adopting a variety of instructional techniques and student supports, I strive to impart my love of learning 
		to students and to leave students with a strong knowledge base that they can apply to real world problems. My previous 
		experiences, including seven years of experience teaching mathematics at the secondary level, have prepared me to teach and work with students from diverse backgrounds and in a variety of settings.
