	<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
	<p>My courses are designed to facilitate development of analytical skills and introduce students to alternate viewpoints within 
	a respectful environment in which students are encouraged to challenge dominant views and unearth underlying assumptions. By providing 
	exposure to different disciplines and viewpoints, rigorous analytical training, and by facilitating peer-to- peer learning, my courses will
	prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers, and decision-makers to design equitable and sustainable strategies to improve the outcomes 
	of human communities and natural ecosystems. </p>
