		<h4>Assessment of Vulnerability and Resilience </h4>
		
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/vuln.jpg" alt="" /></span>My vulnerability and resilience assessment research is focused on 
		integrating core concepts in socio-environmental system planning in order to facilitate assessments that lead to positive system outcomes 
		by considering utility and equity across multiple spatial and temporal scales.	This work is intended to inform community planning, policy 
		and practice, therefore, consideration of practioner utility of developed assessment frameworks and tools plays a key role in guiding the 
		current and future development of this research. Completed work conducted in collaboration with 
		<a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2016/after-military-pentagon-career-phd-student-starts-fulfilling-lifelong-dream/">Leslie Gillespie-Marthaler</a>, 
		<a href="http://hibabaroud.com/"> Hiba Baroud</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/mark-abkowitz"> Mark Abkowitz</a> 	include a conceptual synthesis study identifying the linkages and 
		dependencies between the concepts of Resilience, Vulnerability, and Sustainability and development of a proposed dynamic assessment framework 
		for social-environmental systems that includes elements of all three concepts.  Ongoing work includes indentification of a set of foundational 
		indicators for dynamic resilience assessments, development of an indicator selection tool for community resilience assessment practicioners,
		and an application of the framework in a case study of a flooded community.	Additional completed work related to assessments focused on 
		extending dasymetric mapping techniques for <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001551">high resolution social vulnerability mapping</a> and developing a screening tool 
		for <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/4/3/28/htm"> regional transportation vulnerability assessments</a>.

		<h4>Impacts of Policies and Institutions</h4>
		<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/tvp.jpg" alt="" /></span> My research related to the impacts of policies and institutions on humans and 
		the environment includes quantitative studies of  water scarcity, urban flooding, and inland waterway shipping. Water scarcity projects have focused on 
		investigating human structured and spatially dependent effects of drought and water shortages in social-environmental systems. Completed work includes a 
		study investigating the effect of legally structured access to surface water on agricultural productivity during drought in California's Central Valley 
		using multilevel Bayesian spatiotemporal analysis conducted in collaboration with <a href="https://ekburchfield.wordpress.com/about/"> Emily Burchfield.</a>
		Further work in water scarcity will investigate non-linearities in crop-specific drought response and spatial dependencies in individual perceptions of water 
		scarcity in Latin America. Ongoing flood impact projects are focused on examining the costs and benefits of: implemented flood adaptation measures, social 
		vulnerability and ecosystem services. Projects related to inland waterway shipping have examined the effects of Waterway Action Plans on commercial 
		shipping operations by simulating tow traffic responses to implementation of extreme weather induced operational procedures. Completed work includes
		the development of an agent-based model of tow traffic on a generic navigable inland waterway with multiple locks and dams. Ongoing work includes
		a calibration and validation of the developed agent-based model with an independent observed data set of tow movements and a case study of the impacts
		of regulatory guidelines on navigation given conditions of a historical incident.
