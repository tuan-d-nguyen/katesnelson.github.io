		<p>His K-12 research has two separate strands: a) teacher leadership and school improvement in a research-practice 
								partnership, and b) teacher policies and teacher labor markets. In the first strand of his research, he has been 
								involved in teacher leadership and school improvement work with the IES-funded National Center on Scaling Up Effective 
								Schools (NCSU), a research-practice partnership aimed at linking researchers with practitioners to improve educational 
								outcomes of traditionally underserved high school students in Florida and Texas. The second strand of his K-12 research 
								focuses on teacher policies and the teacher labor markets, particularly looking at the factors that drive teacher attrition 
								and retention, and the reforms and policies intended to address these issues for social equity and school improvement. His work 
								on teacher merit pay has been covered by local and national press, including write-ups in Education Week, The Atlanta Journal 
								Constitution, The Chalkbeat, and Wisconsin Public Radio. Due to his research assistantship with Brent Evans, he also has research 
								interests and experience in higher education. In this area, his research focuses on the distribution of financial aid and its 
								effects on postsecondary persistence and degree attainment, particularly for underserved and disadvantaged students.
