			My K-12 research has two separate strands: a) teacher leadership and school improvement in a research-practice 
		partnership, and b) teacher policies and teacher labor markets. In the first strand of this research, I have been 
		involved in teacher leadership and school improvement work with the IES-funded 
		<a href = "https://my.vanderbilt.edu/scalingupcenter/">National Center on Scaling Up Effective 
		Schools (NCSU)</a>, a research-practice partnership aimed at linking researchers with practitioners to improve educational 
		outcomes of traditionally underserved high school students in Florida and Texas. The second strand of my K-12 research 
		focuses on teacher policies and the teacher labor markets, particularly looking at the factors that drive teacher attrition 
		and retention, and the reforms and policies intended to address these issues for social equity and school improvement. I also have research 
		interests and experience in higher education. In this area, my research focuses on the distribution of financial aid and its 
		effects on postsecondary persistence and degree attainment, particularly for underserved and disadvantaged students.
